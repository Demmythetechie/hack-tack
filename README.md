  ## Where your shopping is optimized.
  Hack & Tack is a fashion brand that allows you to listen to music while shopping to help you make better-informed decisions. This idea was borne out of the fact, that research has shown that while people listen to music, it allows their brain to function better and gives them more clarity.
